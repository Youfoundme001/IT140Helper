# IT140Helper
A python script to auto unzip the Best Submissions from Zybooks and return a printout of the files.


This program is a simple script that Unzips a file recursivley until the final .py file is extracted.  At this point the file is then renamed to match the students last name EX: lastname.py

The current version of this script returns a dictionary printout (JSON Format) showing the comments left in each student file.

Future Dev:
Have it combine all files into a single printout/file and highlight key points.
